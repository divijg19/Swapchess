# Swapchess
Chess variant in Go

In development: February 2026

Every piece you move is swapped randomly with another piece of the same colour.

Swapping does not occur for moves that are checks, and the move after.

TUI implementation using BubbleTea, and a Native 2D Windowed application built using Ebiten will follow.

credits to a friend for the idea, who I'll likely collaborate with to develop this game.
